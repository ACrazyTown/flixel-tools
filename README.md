# flixel-tools

A couple of **[HaxeFlixel](https://haxeflixel.com)** tools I made to help me port **[Kill The Twitter Bird](https://github.com/ACrazyTown/TwitterBird)** to said HaxeFlixel. Decided I might as well open-source it so I did.

Currently, the only available tool is the Adjustment Tool, which makes adjusting objects easier.

## Building

Building this is VERY simple because it's HaxeFlixel, I mean like come on man.

**1.** Install **[HaxeFlixel](https://haxeflixel.com)** (follow the instructions on their page because its the best way :thubmsup (and i am lazy))

After that, you should be able to build it by opening the command prompt in the root of the project directory and typing `lime test html5`
